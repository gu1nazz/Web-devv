         <h3>Method</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Whisk together the gochujang, rice vinegar, soy sauce, garlic and ginger in a shallow dish to make a smooth paste.<br><br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong>Add the salmon to the gochujang mixture and stir to combine.<br><br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong>Heat the rice according to the packet instructions and set aside.<br><br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong>Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the salmon pieces. Almost as soon as you’ve added the salmon to the pan, turn the bites over with tongs. Add the rest of the sauce from the dish and stir before removing from the heat. The salmon bites should be just cooked through.<br><br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong>Serve the salmon and any sauce from the pan with the rice, cucumber and kimchi. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds, if using.

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Cook the pasta in a saucepan of boiling water according to the packet instructions until just tender (al dente). Drain and reserve 100ml/3½fl oz cooking water<br><br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong>Meanwhile, heat the butter and oil in a shallow casserole dish or frying pan with a lid over a medium–low heat. Fry the leek, spring onion and thyme leaves for 5 minutes, stirring regularly until starting to soften. Do not allow the leeks to take on any colour – keep an eye on them and reduce the temperature if necessary.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong>Place the salmon fillets on top of the leeks, season really well with salt and pepper and add the lemon zest and juice. Cover with a lid and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Remove the lid, flip the salmon over, cover and cook for a further 3 minutes.<br><br>
             <strong>Step 4:</strong>Transfer the salmon to a plate and set aside. Stir the crème fraîche into the leek mixture then slowly add the reserved pasta water. Bring to a bubble and season to taste with salt and pepper.<br><br>
             <strong>Step 5:</strong>Stir in the pasta and allow to heat through. Divide between two plates and flake a salmon fillet over each plate.<br><br>
